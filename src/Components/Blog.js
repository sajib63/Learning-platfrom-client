                SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational
                databases. (Relational databases model data as records in rows and
                tables with logical links between them). NoSQL is a class of DBMs
                that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL.

                JavaScript is a simple programming language that can be used with
                any browser that has the JavaScript Engine installed. Node. js, on

                How NodeJS handle multiple client requests? NodeJS receives
                multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS
                is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has
                its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests
                and processes them
